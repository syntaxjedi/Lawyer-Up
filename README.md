# Lawyer Up
Lawyer Up is a game all about rising through the ranks from dirt poor law student, to high class millionaire lawyer.
(written with C#, I don't know why GitHub says javascript)

# Planned Features
* Mini-Games: Fight your way through court using only your wits, knowledge, and a really cool hat you found outside.
* Customizable Character: Make your little lawyer represent you and all your weird "fashion" choices.
* Player Housing: Let's be honest, does anyone play games that /don't/ have player housing anymore?
* Money: Get all the money! Become a millionaire! Fulfill your dreams of owning a bed filled with live bunnies, they're so fluffy!
* Much More: This isn't just added because I can't think of anything...
